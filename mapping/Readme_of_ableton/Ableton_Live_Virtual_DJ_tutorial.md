## **Part 1: Session Preparation & Track Importation**

Follow these correct setup to ensure session is configured.

### **Step 1: Open the Ableton Live Project**


When the project opens, you'll be in Ableton's **Session View**.  

*   **Audio Tracks 1-5:** These are vertically aligned and I labeled them as `BASS`, `DRUM`, `GUITAR`, `KEYBOARD`, `OTHER`. These are the channels for the audio files.
*   **Audio Track 6 (`Dials`):**  **All audio from tracks 1-5 is mapped to a sound effects through dials.**
   
### **Step 3: The Critical Task - Importing Your Audio**

1.  **Prepare Files:** Have the folder containing five audio stems (bass.wav, drum.wav, etc.) open and visible on screen.

2.  **Drag and Drop with Precision:**
    *   Click on **bass** audio file, hold the mouse button down, and drag it from your folder.
    *   Move your cursor over the Ableton Live window and drop the file directly onto the main grid area of the track labeled `BASS`. A new audio clip representing bassline will appear in the first available slot.

3.  **Repeat for All Stems:** 
The mapping I have made: ( you could customise by simplily click map on the screen to mape the dials to the audio effect parameter, the dial are controlled by x, y coordinate of both hand's landmark 8, and could be easily customised too.) 
 Here are some example mapping i have done so far

*   **`LHX` — AUTO FILTER (Low-Pass Filter Sweep)**
    *  It smoothly sweeps away high frequencies, creating a muffled, underwater sound that can build to a powerful, bright release.
      
*   **`RHY` — ECHO THROW (Delay Burst)**
    *  Sends a temporary, high-feedback burst of echo to the track, creating a classic delay tail that fades out.
    *  The effect will trigger as u wave and then decay naturally. Maybe could be used for the end of a vocal phrase, adding drama to a single drum hit, or creating a sense of space during a transition.
 This is one to many mapping. You could produce multiple mapping by duplicate the mapping track and map the dials to your desired parameter. 
*   **`LHX' — BASS KILL:** Instantly removes all low-end frequencies. Use this to create tension and make the bass drop feel even more powerful when you bring it back in.

Example use:
1.  **The Setup (8 bars before the drop):** Let the track play normally. Get a feel for the rhythm.
2.  **Building Tension (4 bars before the drop):**
    *   Engage the **LHX** by sweeping horizontally.  
    *   Begin a slow, dramatic filter sweep.
3.  **The Climax (Final 2 beats before the drop):**
    *   While still sweeping with LHX, start with RHX to introduce the stutter effect. 
4.  **The Release (The "Drop"):**
    *   On the first beat of the drop, **move both hand downwards simultaneously**.
      
### **Creative Combinations to Explore**

*   **The Atmospheric Fade-Out:** Combine the left downward movement with right upward movement to make the track sound like it's fading into a distant, dubby space.
*   **The Vocal Spotlight:** During a vocal section, engage the LHX(again one parameter mapped to at least 3 effect parameter to make it sounds more complex) to isolate the vocal and mid-range instruments, creating an intimate moment.

## **Tips**

*   The most powerful effects are those used sparingly and with intention. A single, well-timed filter sweep is more effective than constant, chaotic effects.  
  
### Creating New Audio Tracks

1.  Open Ableton Live project.
2.  In either the **Session View** (vertical columns) or **Arrangement View** (horizontal timeline), go to the main menu at the top of the screen.
3.  Click on **Create** > **Insert Audio Track**.
4.  Alternatively,the keyboard shortcut:
    *   **Mac**: `Cmd + T`
    *   **Windows**: `Ctrl + T`

### Loading Your Audio Files

Now that you have six empty audio tracks, you can import your audio files.

1.  Open your computer's file explorer (Finder on Mac, File Explorer on Windows) and navigate to where your audio files are saved.
2.  Arrange your windows so you can see both Ableton Live and your folder of audio files.
3.  Click and drag each audio file individually into its own dedicated audio track in Ableton Live.
    *   In **Arrangement View**, drag each file to the start of a different track on the timeline.
    *   In **Session View**, drag each file into an empty clip slot on a different track column.


## 2. Load the Patch

Next, you will create a separate track to load your patch. This patch is a **Max for Live device**, and you can load it as an instrument or an audio effect.

### Step 1: Create a New Track for the Patch

*   **If your patch is an instrument:** Create a MIDI track.
    *   Go to **Create** > **Insert MIDI Track**.
    *   **Mac Shortcut**: `Shift + Cmd + T`
    *   **Windows Shortcut**: `Shift + Ctrl + T`
*   **If your patch is an audio effect:** You can add it to an existing audio track or create a new audio track for it using the method described in the first section (`Cmd + T` or `Ctrl + T`).

### Step 2: Drag the Patch into the Track

1.  Locate your patch file. You can find it in Ableton's Browser under **Max for Live**, or you can drag it directly from your computer's file explorer.
2.  Click and drag the patch file from the browser or your folder onto the new track you just created.
    *   If it's an **instrument**, drop it onto the MIDI track. The patch will load in the Device View at the bottom of the screen.
