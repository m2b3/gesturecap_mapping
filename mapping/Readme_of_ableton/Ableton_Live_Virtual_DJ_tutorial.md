## **Part 1: Session Preparation & Track Importation**

Follow these correct setup to ensure session is configured.

### **Step 1: Open the Ableton Live Project**


When the project opens, you'll be in Ableton's **Session View**.  

*   **Audio Tracks 1-5:** These are vertically aligned and I labeled them as `BASS`, `DRUM`, `GUITAR`, `KEYBOARD`, `OTHER`. These are the channels for the audio files.
*   **Audio Track 6 (`Dials`):**  **All audio from tracks 1-5 is mapped to a sound effects through dials.**
   
### **Step 3: The Critical Task - Importing Your Audio**

1.  **Prepare Files:** Have the folder containing five audio stems (bass.wav, drum.wav, etc.) open and visible on screen.

2.  **Drag and Drop with Precision:**
    *   Click on **bass** audio file, hold the mouse button down, and drag it from your folder.
    *   Move your cursor over the Ableton Live window and drop the file directly onto the main grid area of the track labeled `BASS`. A new audio clip representing bassline will appear in the first available slot.

3.  **Repeat for All Stems:** 
The mapping I have made: ( you could customise by simplily click map on the screen to mape the dials to the audio effect parameter, the dial are controlled by x, y coordinate of both hand's landmark 8, and could be easily customised too.) 
 Here are some example mapping i have done so far

*   **`LHX` — AUTO FILTER (Low-Pass Filter Sweep)**
    *  It smoothly sweeps away high frequencies, creating a muffled, underwater sound that can build to a powerful, bright release.
      
*   **`RHY` — ECHO THROW (Delay Burst)**
    *  Sends a temporary, high-feedback burst of echo to the track, creating a classic delay tail that fades out.
    *  The effect will trigger as u wave and then decay naturally. Maybe could be used for the end of a vocal phrase, adding drama to a single drum hit, or creating a sense of space during a transition.
 This is one to many mapping. You could produce multiple mapping by duplicate the mapping track and map the dials to your desired parameter. 
*   **`LHX' — BASS KILL:** Instantly removes all low-end frequencies. Use this to create tension and make the bass drop feel even more powerful when you bring it back in.

Example use:
1.  **The Setup (8 bars before the drop):** Let the track play normally. Get a feel for the rhythm.
2.  **Building Tension (4 bars before the drop):**
    *   Engage the **LHX** by sweeping horizontally.  
    *   Begin a slow, dramatic filter sweep.
3.  **The Climax (Final 2 beats before the drop):**
    *   While still sweeping with LHX, start with RHX to introduce the stutter effect. 
4.  **The Release (The "Drop"):**
    *   On the first beat of the drop, **move both hand downwards simultaneously**.
      
### **Creative Combinations to Explore**

*   **The Atmospheric Fade-Out:** Combine the left downward movement with right upward movement to make the track sound like it's fading into a distant, dubby space.
*   **The Vocal Spotlight:** During a vocal section, engage the LHX(again one parameter mapped to at least 3 effect parameter to make it sounds more complex) to isolate the vocal and mid-range instruments, creating an intimate moment.

## **Tips**

*   The most powerful effects are those used sparingly and with intention. A single, well-timed filter sweep is more effective than constant, chaotic effects.
